This is where I write about the things I'm working on and playing
with: (functional) programming; bash, clojure, coffeescript, erlang,
haskell, ruby, scala; css, html; debian, gentoo, ubuntu; gnu, linux;
vim; free software; computer science, mathematics; ...

Most of my code is on [GitHub](https://github.com/obfusk).
