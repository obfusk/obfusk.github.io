title:  A New "Blog"

---

```python3
print("Hello, Blog!")
```

I reworked this site and rewrote the [static HTML
generator](https://github.com/obfusk/obfusk.github.io) in Python a
while back, but I finally got around to re-adding a blog part.

I'm keeping it really simple for now: just a single page.  Most of my
entries will be pretty short probably, and if I want a longer piece I
can just add a page and link to it from here.  That's the flexibility
you get when you write everything yourself.

For now, I got to play around with jinja2, markdown and pygments :)
