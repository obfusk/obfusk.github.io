I prefer to set my `umask` to `077` so no one can read my files.  For
the most part, using `sudo` (which inherits the `umask`) works just
fine.  Except when using e.g. `vim sudo` where it make sense to
respect the umask, I hadn't run into trouble.  Until now.

It seems `sudo update-alternatives` results in
`/var/lib/dpkg/alternatives/*` no longer being readable by anyone but
root, which is not quite what I intended.  So I had to figure out how
to make `sudo` play nice with `umask` without setting a default
`umask` in the `sudoers` file.

The solution I came up with: `umask 022` in `~root/.profile` and using
`sudo -i` when I don't want my user's `umask` to be used.
