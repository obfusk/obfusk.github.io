Most of you will have heard about the Heartbleed Bug by now.  Here is a quick
overview and some useful links.

According to [heartbleed.com](http://heartbleed.com) (emphasis mine):

> The Heartbleed Bug is a **serious vulnerability** in the popular **OpenSSL
cryptographic software** library. This weakness allows **stealing the
information protected**, under normal conditions, by the **SSL/TLS** encryption
used to secure the Internet. SSL/TLS provides communication security and
privacy over the Internet for applications such as **web**, **email**,
**instant messaging** (IM) and some virtual private networks (**VPNs**).

> The Heartbleed bug allows **anyone on the Internet** to **read the memory of
the systems** protected by the vulnerable versions of the OpenSSL software.
This **compromises the secret keys** used to identify the service providers and
to encrypt the traffic, the **names and passwords** of the users and the
**actual content**. This allows attackers to **eavesdrop** on communications,
**steal data** directly from the services and users and to **impersonate
services and users**.

* Many (web) servers using openssl may have **leaked private keys, user
  names, passwords, session cookies**, and any other data handled by the server
  including **(confidential) emails and documents**.  Leaked private keys can
  be used to **decrypt intercepted traffic** and perform **man-in-the-middle
  attacks**.

* The affected versions of openssl have been in widespread use since 2012, the
  bug is easily exploitable, and attacks leave no trace -- therefore, **it
  should be taken very seriously**.

* Those **servers need to be patched**, the **compromised keys** need to be
  **replaced and revoked**.  Any **data** that may have been **intercepted** or
  **leaked** should be **considered compromised**.  Unfortunately, certificate
  revocation does not work as well as it should and many network appliances and
  other embedded systems, for example, are not easily patched.

* Users will need to **change passwords** once services have **patched
  the bug** and started using **new keys** -- users should **not log
  into accounts from afflicted sites** until they have confirmation
  that the service has been patched.  Unfortunately, many services
  have not yet released information regarding whether they were
  vulnerable or not, and if so, whether they have taken the necessary
  steps to fix the bug.

* Not just servers are affected.  **Client side software** could **expose
  data from your computer** if it connects to **compromised servers**.
  Fortunately, Firefox and Chromium do not seem to use openssl.

* You may even want to **change all passwords**, even for services not
  affected, just in case someone managed to break into your email account and
  used it to change those passwords.

* Some advice from [MyKolab][mykolab]:
  - Keep your systems updated
  - Encrypt your devices
  - Lock your screens
  - Never re-use passwords
  - Choose good passwords
  - Regularly change your passwords

<!-- -->

* Firefox users may be interested in [certificate
  patrol](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/certificate-patrol),
  an add-on that reveals when ssl certificates are updated.

* See [the Heartbleed article on
  Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heartbleed) and the
  resources listed below for more information.
