title: building a "blog"
category: misc
tags:
- blog
- ruby
- github

I wrote some ruby code that turns markdown (w/ help from pygments for
syntax highlighting) + haml into the static html (for github pages) of
my "blog".

I've also made lists of my interesting github
[projects](/projects.html), and [gists](/gists.html).

```coffeescript
console.log 'coffee!'
```

```haskell
main = putStrLn "haskell!"
```
